(-)-(2S)-5-methyl-2-[(1S)-1-methylprop-2-enyl]hex-4-en-1-ol - possesses a floral rosy, natural note, very fine, presenting multiple aspects, slightly rosinol and green, reminding a little of rose oxide. It provokes indeed odor notes of the family of roses and geranium, with an extremely refined character which evokes the best fractions of rose oil.	NA
(+)-(2R)-5-methyl-2-[(1R)-1-methylprop-2-enyl]hex-4-en-1-ol - develops a floral odorant note, rosy, with a dimension of Rosacène (floral composition; origin: Firmenich SA), tea rose - more pronounced than that of its (S,S)-isomer to which the odor is however closer to that of citronellol.	NA

(R)-(-)-Sulcatol - Both enantiomers of sulcatol were odoriferous to the human nose and smelled like geraniol with almost no difference in the odor as tested by the noses of the author (Mori) and his students	NA
(3R)-(+)-Aurantiol - an orange flower fragrance that is not much different from those (prepared from) the other isomeric (d- or dl) forms of hydroxycitronellal, but a more irritating odor, less clean, and less (or none) of the green note as compared to the laevo form. (Yamamato)	NA
(3S)-(-)-Aurantiol - an orange flower fragrance that is not much different from those (prepared from) the other isomeric (d- or dl) forms of hydroxycitronellal, but with a less irritating odor and imparts a clean and green note note as compared to the dextro or racemic forms; therefore, the impression of this substance was that it was of higher quality than the other forms.
