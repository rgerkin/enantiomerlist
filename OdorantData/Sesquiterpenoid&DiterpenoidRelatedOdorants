Sesquiterpenoid & Diterpenoid Related Odorants	.
(-)-(1R,3R,6S,7S,8S)-patchoulol - a strong, typical patchouli scent with an earthy, slightly camphoraceous, powdery cellar note which was indistinguishable from natural patchoulol; deep woody like patchouli oil	NA
(+)-(1S,3S,6R,7R,8R)-patchoulol - much weaker, less characteristic, nearly indefinable and by no means reminiscent of patchouli. It might have a beta-santalol odour with a green undertone; woody with underlying green notes	NA
(-)-(1S,3R,6S,7S,8S)- patchoulenol - The odour profile of (-)-patchoulenol can be described as patchouli-like camphoraceous whose earthy cellar note is there more pronounced than in (-)-patchouli alcohol. A slight galbanum scent is also recognized.	NA
(+)-(1R,3S,6R,7R,8R)-patchoulenol - is much weaker than its antipode, less earthy and also less patchouli-like; however, it possesses a weak but fine woody, warm amber tone.	NA
(2S, 4aS)-(-)-alpha-ambrinol - powerful amber note with a natural, somewhat musky and animal character	NA
(2R, 4aR)-(+)-alpha-ambrinol - exhibits a strongly dry earthy, musty tonality, reminiscent of geosmine	NA
(-)-Ambrox® - moist, soft, creamy, persistent, warm, animalic, amber odor with a velvety effect	0.3
(+)-Ambrox® - accentuated woody note and lacks the strong animalic warmth" of the (-)-isomer	2.4
(-)-((5S,8R,9R,10S)-8a,13-desoxyambreinolide - Strong; this material was mostly described as woody ambergris-like in the sense of the tonality of the standard odorant Ambrox; the descriptions musky and balsamic followed. Owing to its additional warm animal note this ether resembles ambergris most.	9
(+)-((5R,8S,9S,10R)-8a,13-desoxyambreinolide - A weaker woody character although its intensity and ambergris tonality differed considerably from that of its enantiomer; 20% of panelists found it to be odorless.

(+)-(5S,8S,9R,10S)-8b,13-desoxyambreinolide - Virtually odorless	NA
(-)-(5R,8R,9S,10R)-8b,13-desoxyambreinolide - Strongly odorous, but not ambergris-like. Of the 30 panelists - Minty-camphoraceous (6 females & 8 males), fruity (2 females & 4 males) and balsamic (3 males) were the most frequent replies. Four participants (2 females & 2 males) described this enantiomer as musk-like and woody; However, none of the subjects could identify ambergris-like tonalities in this enantiomer.	NA
(+)-(5S,8R,9R,10S)-20-desmethyl-8a,13-desoxyambreinolide - Moderately strong odor - Mostly described as woody ambergris-like in the sense of the tonality of the standard odorant Ambrox; the descriptions musky and balsamic followed. However, practically 50% of the subjects being extremely odor-sensitive, including all the female participants, indicated tonalities (green, moss and ionone-lke) which cannot or can only with difficulty be associated with ambergris. Less sensitive subjects, however, committed fewer errors.	NA
(-)-(5R,8S,9S,10R)-20-desmethyl-8a,13-desoxyambreinolide - Strong odor; Six out of eight subjects ascribed woody ambergris-like odor qualities to the strong odor of this nor-ether, although its intensity and ambergris tonality differed considerably.

Neither subject could detect ambergris-like scents in any of this series	NA
